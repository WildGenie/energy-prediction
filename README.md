What is the SOTA technique for forecasting day-ahead and intraday market prices for electricity in Germany?

## Introduction

Free electricity markets are governed by a strong supply-demand dynamics. The key reason is that electricity can't be stored, so what is generated needs to be used up instantly. This makes forecasting demands essential to the business.  
From an economic standpoint, there are three key markets in which electricity is traded:

- **futures market**: the price is set (upto 6 years) in advance, though you pay a premium for this assurance,  
- **day-ahead market**: the price is set a day before,  
- **intra-day market**: the price is set upto ? minutes before?   

The project is explained in the following parts:
