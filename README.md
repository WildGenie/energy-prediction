What is the SOTA technique for forecasting day-ahead and intraday market prices for electricity in Germany?

The following techniques are attempted:
Standard ML techniques for time-series forecasting:
1. Seasonal ARIMA model
2. ETS  and Holtz-Winter model
3. Dynamic harmonic regression
4. Prophet
  
Deep learning models:  
1. RNN, LSTM, GRU and convolutional LSTM
2. Inception Time [WIP]
3. Hybrid ES-RNN [WIP]
4. LSTM-MSNet [WIP]
